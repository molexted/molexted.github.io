The Epoch of Reionization is, in a sense, the beginning of the Universe proper,
a time which the Universe gained order, form, and diversity it had not
previously had. This period was arguably the most important part of the Universe's
history despite its short reign spanning from about 400 million years after the
Big Bang up until approximately the billionth year of the Universe, and it is
only recently that, with the help of some of the most impressive instrumentation
hardware ever devised, this exciting period of the Universe is starting to come
into view.

*Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep.*
*And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.*
*And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.*
--Genesis 1:2-4

<br/>

Indeed, in the beginning, the Universe was essentially formless and void. The Big
Bang, a period in which the Universe expanded by untold factors, left a universe
that was essentially isotropic (of the same shape no matter what orientation it
was looked at) and smooth: every point in space was essentially
indistinguishable from any other point in space.

While the Big Bang itself was a very hot event that allowed enough energy to
fuse together the building blocks in protons and neutrons and electrons into the
atoms that would eventually build the Sun and our Solar System, the ensuing
period afterwards saw the universe cool to the extent where this could no longer
happen.

This period, recombination, saw the opaque gas of ionized hydrogen (which was by
far the most common atom created ine Big Bang) turn into molecular hydrogen, the
kind that we recognize on Earth. This molecular hydrogen is clear to most types
of light, and as such, the Universe became clear to light for the first time
in its history, lifting the fog on the Universe that had been imposed on
observers since its birth.

The universe at this time is a huge volume of hydrogen of nearly even density.
However, it is not quite perfectly even in density, a property reflected today
in a snapshot of the recombination period called the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB), which found that the Universe was warmer (very slightly) in some parts of
the sky than others, and therefore slighly less dense, in the same way that the
air in hot air balloons is less dense than the air around it. This slight lack
of smoothness is essential in the creation of our very distinct and clearly not
perfectly even Universe of today.

Why it is only a part per ten thousand away from being smooth while not being
perfectly smooth is not known, as are many other questions about the reasons why
the Universe's starting conditions are such that they are. It is this very
slight imperfection, however, that allows for what will soon occur to transform
the Universe. The force now that is given sway in this uneven universe is one we
experience every day: gravity. It is by the hand of gravity, then, that did the
work of dividing the light from the dark to create the modern Universe.

This is a contemporary protostar, a reasonable facsimile of what the earliest
blooming stars in the Universe may have resembled. We cannot see individual
stars form from this era, as they are some thirteen billion years in the past
and therefore proportionally far away (due to the finite speed of light), but
the physics are relatively similar now as they were in those early days.

Protostars like this one gain energy from the speed gained by particles
collapsing inwards on the nascent star, giving them the energy that allows for
the beginning of nuclear fusion, lighting the Universe anew with intense
radiation capable once again of imparting enough energy into nearby hydrogen
atoms to drive them into an ionized state, creating an epoch of reionization of
the universe, creatively called the Epoch of Reionication by astronomers.

These early bloomers are the first glimpses of the Universe we know today, and
their existence, as far as we know, was not very long: no stars from this
original period seem to exist today, as they probably formed very large and have
correspondingly short lifetimes. Like these stars, though, the Universe itself
was living at a breakneck pace, and it would soon be filled with stars that
would follow these pioneers (called Population III stars), including our own
star, the Sun.

At the time of about 300 hundred million years since the Big Bang, the Universe
was an unrecognizable, smooth mush; five hundred million years later,
a time period approximately as long as species such as horseshoe crab have
existed on Earth, the Universe had become eminently recognizable to our own. It
is this astounding progression that inspires the great deal of research that has
gone into this time period of history, research that has been aided by some of
the most impressive and expansive instrumentation in astronomy, instruments that
rival other great feats of engineering for the most impressive works that
humanity has wrought.

Perhaps the most famous radio telescope is Aricebo, located in Puerto Rico. Its
thousand foot dish was one of the largest structures in the world when it was
built, a structure worthy of being a backdrop for a James Bond film (GoldenEye).
It has since been passed in its size by dishes such as the Five hundred meter
Apeture Spherical Telescope (1600') in China, as well as by telescope arrays
such as the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), but the scale of any of these
instruments is nearly unparalleled. These telescopes can be so big because they
don't have to be precise to quite the same levels as optical telescopes, and in
their size they allow for some incredibly fine resolution imaging of a very old
Universe.

Radio telescopes are particularly suitable for seeing the conditions of the
universe, which can not only see the very faint backdrop of the fireball from
which the Universe started, but also the tale told by a hint left in the quantum
mechanics of the hydrogen atom.

This fascinating and very useful property of the hydrogen atom, which makes up
the vast majority of the Universe, is its 21 centimeter spin-flip transition.
Essentially, the hydrogen atom can undergo a spontaneous reorganization of its
magnetic poles, releasing a vibration in the form of light that is 21
centimeters in wavelength.

It is this rare and random vibration that radio telescopes can use to map out
where neutral hydrogen atoms live and therefore where the stuff in the Universe
is. This map of neutral hydrogen, that which has not been perturbed by intense
starlight, is the map of how energy and matter was and is distributed through
our universe, and as such is one of the keys to mapping out the Epoch of
Reionization, and in doing so, the formative years of the Universe of today.

While this picture is swamped by our two nearest galaxies, the Milky Way and
the Magellenic Clouds, its mapping of the neutral hydrogen is a key cog in
understanding the Epoch of Reionization. The densities of neutral hydrogen gas
in the Universe can tell astronomers how the Universe must have evolved to reach
the state it is seen in today, as light from faraway hydrogen clouds at an
earlier stage of the Universe reach our present day much later than when the
light was generated.

While radio astronomy is perhaps the most widely used tool in probing the Epoch
of Reionization, this article would be remiss in not briefly mentioning visible
and infrared imaging of structures from this era. This is an exceptionally
difficult task, as these objects are necessarily ~13 billion years old and the
light has to have traveled towards Earth for that entire time, making objects
from this era very dim and hard to detect. Indeed, evidence for galaxies (the
*smallest* structures visible at these distances and lookback times) looks
something like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/z10_vlt.jpg">

Understandably, a great cover for *Nature* this does not make, and this is the
cost of being the first generation to see so deeply into the Universe's history.
Even so, higher-frequency telescopes like the 8.2m visible-band telescope used
to image this galaxy-like object are indeed useful cogs in finding the first
structures the Universe assembled.

Notable galaxies imaged in this way include Cosmos Redshift 7 (seen as it was
800 million years after the Big Bang), EGSY8p7 (570 million years old),
and GN-z11 (400 million years old); these very old galaxies, seen as they were
about 13 billion years ago, complement the radio telescope findings of hydrogen
to help compete a picture of the Universe in these early days.

The understanding of the Epoch of Reionization is rapidly emerging, and with any
luck, soon we will be able to pry back the lid a little more and capture this
period in the Universe's history a little more. With any luck, we'll soon be
able to live in the past just a little more.∎
